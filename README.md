# What is Tipsease?

- Instead of a service worker having to go through their employer to collect their tips, Tipsease allows the collection of tips directly from consumers. In addition to being quicker, it facilitates a direct connection between consumer and worker, potentially resulting in higher tips for the worker.
 

## Tech Used
- React
- Semantic UI
- Redux

## Work in Progress
- As of right now you're only able to register as a user or an employee. As a user you can sign in and view available workers and are able to tip them. 

- Nothing on the worker side has been implemented yet.
